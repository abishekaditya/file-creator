# file-creator README

Select any text in your open editor and open it in a new tab, or create the file if it doesn't exist.

## Features

Works with relative paths (relative to the open file).

1. Can create a file and jump to it by selecting text from editor.
2. Can open an existing file and jump to it by selecting text from editor.

**TODO**: Add Demo

## Keybindings

This extension uses the following keybindings:

* `shift + ctrl(cmd) + i`: Creates the file for selected text
* `alt(option) + ctrl(cmd) + i`: Opens the file for selected text

## Known Issues

Selecting text inside quotes will not work as expected. Next release will take care of that.

Plan to add customization options in the future.
